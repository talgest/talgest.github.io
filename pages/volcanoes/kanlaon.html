          <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
          <p class="page-first-content">
            Kanlaon volcano, also spelled Canlaon, is the most active volcanoe
            of the central Philippines, forms the highest point on the island of
            Negros. The massive 2435-m high stratovolcano is dotted with
            fissure-controlled pyroclastic cones and craters, many of which are
            filled by lakes. The summit of Canlaon contains a broad elongated
            northern caldera with a crater lake and a smaller, but higher,
            historically active crater to the south.

            </div>
            <p>
              The largest debris avalanche known in the Philippines traveled
              33km to the SW from Canlaon. Historical eruptions, recorded since
              1866, have typically consisted of phreatic explosions of
              small-to-moderate size that produce minor ashfalls near the
              volcano.

          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>1986 - 1989 Eruptions</strong>
            <br />
            As emissions happened at Kanlaon volcano in June 1986. Last June 21,
            1986 ash reached a height of 4000m above the summit combined with an
            earthquake over 8km from the summit. A loud sound by the hazard
            accompanied the ash ejection. The eruption of Kanlaon Volcano in
            April 1987 was preceded by an increase in Sulphate concentration at
            Mambukal 9.75 km N-NW of Kanlaon's summit A phreatic eruption
            occurred at Bulusan Volcano on November 27, 1994, which ejected an
            ash plume at 1.5km altitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second ash explosion in December 3 deposited ashes 7km from the
            volcano. A strong phreatic explosion on December 12, 1994, created a
            3km high ash cloud and caused ashfall 16 km from the volcano. An
            eruption in January 21, 1995, was accompanied by rumbling noises,
            lightning flashes over the summit, and light ashfall at the San
            Benon Observatory 5km SW. Ash emissions happened in June 1988.
            Traces of ash fell in the village of Mananawin on the SE slope at
            980m elevation. On June 27, 1988 ash emissions reached a height of
            500m above the crater, and ash fell on the SW flank. Ash emissions
            happened at Kanlaon volcano between October and December 1989. On
            November 3, 1989, an eruption reached a height of 1200 m above the
            crater. Ground inflation occurred a few hours before ash emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1992 - 1996 Eruption</strong>
            <br />
            A minor earthquake, ash emission, and ashfall occurred at Kanlaon
            volcano on June 10, 1992. Small phreatic explosions happened at
            Kanlaon volcano on August 25, 1993, and September 3, 1993. An
            explosion at Kanlaon volcano killed three people in August 10, 1996.
            There were two climbing groups at the summit at the moment of the
            explosion. Eighteen people were hospitalized due to injuries caused
            mainly by falling ejecta.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2002 - 2006 Eruptions</strong>
            <br />
            An increase in seismicity during January 2002 was followed by a
            small ash emission in November 28, 2002. On March 17, 2003, a
            volcanic plume was observed at Kanlaon volcano. Small eruptions of
            ash and steam reaching about 100m above the active crater were
            observed in the first week of June. In June 8, 2003, an ashfall
            occurred at Canlaon City. After July 23, 2003, weak steam emission
            was noticed, and seismic activity returned to low levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            A short amount of ash emission began at Kanlaon volcano in January
            21, 2005. The emissions reached 500m above the crater. The eruption
            was phreatic. On March 20, 2005, ashfall was reported in La Carlota
            City of Negros Occidental in 5 km west of the volcano. From March
            24, 2005, to April 4, 2005, occasional ash emissions reached 1 km
            above the volcano. Ashfall was reported in different towns.
            Eruptions began in June 3, 2006, and 23 ash eruptions happened from
            July 25, 2006. The eruptions were phreatic and emitted ash and steam
            around 2km above the crater. No significant seismic activity
            occurred before or after the ash emissions, indicating the
            explosions were near surface hydrothermal events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2015 Eruptions</strong>
            <br />
            Ash emissions happened at Kanlaon volcano in December 2015. A 4 km
            radius permanent exclusion zone exists around the volcano.
