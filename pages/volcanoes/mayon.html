          <p class="page-first-content">
            Mayon Volcano, a symmetrical volcano that rises above the Albay Gulf
            NW of Legazpi City, it the most active volcano in the Philippines.
            The steep upper slopes are capped by a small summit crater. Recorded
            eruptions since 1616 CE range from Strombolian to basaltic Plinian,
            with cyclical activity beginning with basaltic eruptions, followed
            by longer-term andesitic lava flows.

            </div>
            <p>
              A popular place to camp and climb, the volcano is the center of
              Mayon Volcano National Park ranging about 21 square miles. There
              are large abaca plantations on its lower slopes. There have been
              more than 30 eruptions recorded since 1616. An eruption in 1993
              caused 79 deaths. Successive eruptions in 2000, 2006, 2009, 2014,
              and 2018 forced tens of thousands of people in nearby villages to
              evacuate.

          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>1814 Eruption</strong>
            <br />
            The eruption of Mayon Volcano in February 1, 1814, was the most
            massive historical eruption at this volcano. The six-hour eruption
            killed 1200 people. Fatalities were caused by pyroclastic density
            currents, port eruption lahars, and fires set alight by hot tephra.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1897 Eruption</strong>
            <br />
            A dreadful eruption began at Mayon volcano on June 23, 1897. Lava
            flowed down the side of the volcano for seven miles towards the
            east. Volcanic ash fell on the surrounding country for 100 miles to
            the east and 75 miles to the west. The eruption finished on June 30,
            1897, and killed around 400 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1968 Eruptions</strong>
            <br />
            An eruption began at Mayon volcano on April 21, 1968. By May 15,
            1968, more than 100 explosions had happened, 6 people had been
            killed, and roughly 100 square km had been covered by ashfall,
            blocky ash flows, and a lava flow. Explosions from the summit crater
            had been released in large quantities of ash and incandescent blocks
            to a height of 600 m and ash plumes 10km high.
          </p>
          <p>
            A short amount of ash emission began at Kanlaon volcano in January
            21, 2005. The emissions reached 500m above the crater. The eruption
            was phreatic. On March 20, 2005, ashfall was reported in La Carlota
            City of Negros Occidental in 5 km west of the volcano. From March
            24, 2005, to April 4, 2005, occasional ash emissions reached 1 km
            above the volcano. Ashfall was reported in different towns.
            Eruptions began in June 3, 2006, and 23 ash eruptions happened from
            July 25, 2006. The eruptions were phreatic and emitted ash and steam
            around 2km above the crater. No significant seismic activity
            occurred before or after the ash emissions, indicating the
            explosions were near surface hydrothermal events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1978 - 1984 Eruption</strong>
            <br />
            An eruption began at Mayon volcano on May 7, 1978, and gradually
            increased in intensity over time, reaching a maximum on 22nd May. A
            lava flow merged from a breach in the summit's crater wall and
            extended down the SW flank directly over the 1968 flow. On June 30,
            1981, typhoon Daling triggered mudflows that killed 40 people,
            injured 9, and left 7 missing. An eruption began on September 10,
            1984, with lava spilling over the crater rim. Incandescent blocks
            rolled 600m down the NW flank, destroying trees. On September 12,
            1984, eruptions became vulcanian in character with pyroclastic flows
            extending several kilometers from the summit, and ash emissions
            rising to a height of 15km.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2006 Eruption</strong>
            <br />
            Eruptions of the Mayon volcano in August 2006 resulted in the
            evacuation of 48,000 people, and 1266 people were killed in December
            2006 when heavy rain from typhoon Durian caused landslides and
            floods at the base of the volcano.
